The new theme should really be called DMind instead of Jupiter child.  If we
switched the theme to DMind, which you could easly do in wp-admin, a lot of
theme settings would be lost. When ready do,

        remove the symbolic link dmind
	mv jupiter-child dmind
	edit dmind/style.css to name the theme dmind
	edit all the necessary settings in wp-admin
